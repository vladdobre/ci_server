# ci_server

## Starting the Server
In order to make the server visible online we need to do the following:
1) Run ngrok.exe and use the following command "ngrok http --domain thrush-engaging-monkfish.ngrok-free.app 8080"

Note: The domain is registered to my ngrok account. If anyone needs to access it, you can go to https://thrush-engaging-monkfish.ngrok-free.app/

Note 2: If the domain is changed for any reason, make sure to update the url in the webhook in Github

2) Add the jars found in the folder with the same name to the dependencies of the project.
3) Compile the project
